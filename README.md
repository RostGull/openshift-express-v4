# Openshift-express-v4

This is a template for Node.js + Express v4.x for OpenShift. This overwrites the older v.3.2.5 Express that OpenShift serves initially. Created due the lack of documentation for upgrading the express.

To run this in OpenShift:
Just push the project in OpenShift and you are good to go!

To run this locally: npm install and npm start.

Template is a general generated express template that is fitted with OpenShift, so feel free to clone for your project root.
